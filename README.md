# Profolio

## Description

A custom protfolio to give users information about me and few projects that are
listed. The projects have a description and images that show the page of the
project. The webpage uses react.js to build components that are resuable and
help build everything showen. React hooks were used to store information and
pass information through out the componenets. The webpage is responsive to
smaller screen and phone screens so people can get all the information no matter
what screen.
